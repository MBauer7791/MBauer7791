- 👋 Hi, I’m @MBauer7791
- 👀 I’m interested in different languages, both spoken and programming. I love food and drink and travel. History is like a big jigsaw puzzle where you learn little bits and put them all together.
- Friends and family mean so much to me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a simple website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an e-commerce site.
